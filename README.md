# MotionBlurMod

this is a motion blur mod for 1.8.9 version

it can provide old motionblur and new motionblur(like lunar client and blc v2)

# Usage

send command /motionblur [old/new] [blurMount]

remember close your fastrender

# bug

When switching perspectives, the screen will go black for 1-2 frames

because the game will close shader when switching perspectives

Even though the mod will reload the shader, there will be a gap
